**Project Description :**    
1. This project aims to create a model that will predict wine quality on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the best, based on physiochemical aspects of exisiting Portuguese wines and their numeric data.  

2. The data was obtained from Data.World via UCI on 01 February 2023, downloaded as two .cvs files (one for red wines, one for white wines), combined into a single file, then cleaned, explored, visualised and modelled. According to the original authors of the database, who were at the University of Minho in Portugal, the data comes from red and white wines in the Vinho Verde region of Portugal.

1.  
- H_0 : The overall quality of the wine has no relationship to its free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide & sulphate levels.  
- H_a : The overall quality of the wine has a relationship to its free sulphur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide & sulphate levels.  

2.  
- H_0 : The levels of citric acid and residual sugar in the wine have no relationship to its quality.  
- H_a : The levels of citric acid and residual sugar in the wine have no relationship to its quality.  

3.  
- H_0 : The levels of fixed acidity and pH in the wine has no relationship to its quality.  
- H_a : The levels of fixed acidity and pH in the wine has a relationship to its quality.  

4.  
- H_0 : The total alcohol level in and the density of the wine have no relationship to its quality.  
- H_a : The total alcohol level in and the density of the wine have a relationship to its quality.
